# yash-gtp-advert
A small site for the purpose of advertising the graduate training program at Yash Technologies. 
## Intended Branch Structure
1. Master
	* The most recent "production ready" build of the site. Ideally, should only be updated via a well-reviewed pull request from develop. 
2. Develop
	* The most recent "beta" build of the site. Contains the amalgamated stable features of any feat/ branches, and should work properly, but is not yet confirmed to be 110% stable (and therefore ready for master). 
3. Feat/
	* Any remaining branches should begin with the tag feat/, and these are the "tinker spaces" where the programmers work on features without fear of dealing with stability.
